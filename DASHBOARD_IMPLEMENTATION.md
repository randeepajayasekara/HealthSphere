## Integration with Other Roles

### Healthcare Provider Integration

The dashboard is designed to be easily adaptable for other roles:

#### Doctor Dashboard Adaptations:

- **Patient Widget**: Quick access to patient records
- **Schedule Widget**: Doctor's appointment schedule
- **Lab Results Widget**: Review patient test results
- **UMID Scanner**: QR code scanner for patient identification

#### Nurse Dashboard Adaptations:

- **Patient Care Widget**: Current patient assignments
- **Medication Administration**: Track medication delivery
- **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Real-time patient monitoring
- **Shift Management**: Nursing schedule and handoffs

#### Admin Dashboard Adaptations:

- **System Overview**: Hospital-wide statistics
- **User Management**: Staff and patient administration
- **Resource Allocation**: Bed and equipment management
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regulatory compliance tracking

### Role-Specific Widget Types

```typescript
// Example role-specific widgets
const doctorWidgets = [
  "patient_list",
  "appointment_schedule",
  "lab_reviews",
  "umid_scanner",
  "prescription_management",
];

const nurseWidgets = [
  "patient_assignments",
  "medication_schedule",
  "vital_monitoring",
  "shift_handoff",
  "emergency_alerts",
];
```
