## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies are already included in the main project:

- `framer-motion` for animations
- `lucide-react` for icons
- `react-hot-toast` for notifications
- `firebase` for backend services

### 2. Database Setup

Seed the initial FAQ data:

```typescript
import seedContactData from "@/app/utils/seed-contact-data";

// Run seeding (typically in admin panel or development setup)
await seedContactData();
```

Or use the admin component:

```tsx
import ContactSeedingButton from "@/app/components/admin/contact-seeding-button";

// In your admin panel
<ContactSeedingButton />;
```

### 3. Configuration

The system uses the existing Firebase configuration from `@/backend/config`.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Contact Form

```tsx
import ContactPage from "@/app/(global)/contact/page";

function App() {
  return <ContactPage />;
}
```

### Custom Contact Hook

```tsx
import { useContact } from "@/hooks/use-contact";

function MyComponent() {
  const { isSubmitting, submitSuccess, faqCategories, submitContactForm } =
    useContact({
      onSuccess: (submissionId) => {
        console.log("Form submitted:", submissionId);
      },
    });

  // Use the hook data and functions
}
```

### Real-time Submissions (Admin)

```tsx
import { useContactSubmissionsRealtime } from "@/hooks/use-contact";

function AdminDashboard() {
  const { submissions } = useContactSubmissionsRealtime({
    status: "submitted",
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {submissions.map((submission) => (
        <div key={submission.id}>
          {submission.subject} - {submission.priority}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
